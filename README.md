# fuckflash  
  
hacky tool to get old macromedia projector skeleton games out of its awful fullscreen mode  
  
VERY WIP - dont use  
  
# content  
consists of two parts    
- fuckflash.dll > the dll file with detours    
- loader.exe > the dll injector/loader  
  
# how to use
drag the exe ontop of the loader PANG it works, maybe  
  
# build  
use 32-bit x86 assembly cause most games are 32-bit, its better to build for that architecture  
> `cargo b -r --target i686-pc-windows-msvc`
